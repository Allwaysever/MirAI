# ALLWAYSEVER CUSTOM LICENSE V5.1 - MirAI Edition (ACL v5.1)

### Effective Date: September 12, 2025

### Preamble: The Philosophy of MirAI
Welcome to MirAI, the artificial intelligence from Allwaysever designed to be your creative partner. We believe that AI is a tool, not a replacement. MirAI is here to help you explore ideas, overcome creative blocks, and discover new ways to express yourself. This license is created to ensure that MirAI is used responsibly and ethically, in order to maintain the integrity of our shared creative ecosystem. By using MirAI, you agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions outlined below. If you do not agree, please close this application, do not use MirAI, and continue with your life without usâ€”but we hope you'll stay.

### Article 1: General Provisions
1.1. License Application: This license governs the use of MirAI as a whole. Allwaysever reserves the right to change this license at any time without prior notice, although we will do our best to inform you, as we don't want to seem like an unfriendly company.
1.2. Definitions:
   * "MirAI": Refers to the AI chatbot developed by Allwaysever.
   * "User": You, the individual or entity using MirAI.
   * "Work": The output or result generated by MirAI based on the User's prompt.
1.3. Limited License: Allwaysever grants the User a non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use MirAI in accordance with the terms set forth in this license.

### Article 2: MirAI Usage and Data Policy
2.1. Responsible Use: MirAI is designed as a creative tool. Use MirAI for constructive and ethical purposes. Do not use MirAI for illegal, harmful, or destructive purposes.
2.2. Input Data Utilization: By using MirAI, you agree that Allwaysever may use your inputs, prompts, and conversations with MirAI (including the generated Works) to improve our models, services, and products. We will do this by processing them anonymously to protect your privacy, as we don't want to know anything about you except how you make MirAI smarter.
2.3. Prohibited Use: The User is strictly prohibited from using MirAI to:
   * Generate or spread false information, hoaxes, or disinformation.
   * Generate hate speech, discriminatory content, or content that is harassing to any individual or group.
   * Generate content that is exploitative, child pornography, or extreme violence.
   * Create deepfakes or media manipulations that can deceive or harm others.
   * Send spam or excessively repetitive messages that disrupt the system or other users.
   * Conduct cyberattacks or attempts to damage or misuse MirAI or its related infrastructure.
   * Input confidential or sensitive data into MirAI. You are fully responsible for the data you provide.
2.4. Attribution Obligation: If you use a Work generated by MirAI in a public, commercial, or non-commercial project, you are required to include a clear attribution. Example: "This work was partially or entirely created with the help of MirAI from Allwaysever." This attribution must be clearly visible and easily accessible. Failure to provide attribution may result in the suspension or revocation of the license.

### Article 3: Acceptable Use Policy
3.1. Fair Use: The use of MirAI must be within reasonable limits. Allwaysever reserves the right to limit or suspend your access if we find unreasonable or excessive use, such as automated use, scripting, or attempts to automate large-scale interactions.
3.2. Ecosystem Integration: The use of MirAI in other ecosystems (e.g., integration with third-party applications) is prohibited without written permission from Allwaysever. Contact us if you have an interesting integration idea.
3.3. Commercialization Prohibition: The User is not permitted to sell, rent, or distribute MirAI itself. However, you are permitted to commercialize the Works you generate with the help of MirAI, as long as you comply with the attribution obligation in Article 2.4.

### Article 4: Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability
4.1. No Warranty: MirAI is provided "as is." Allwaysever makes no warranties, whether express or implied, regarding the reliability, accuracy, or availability of MirAI. We work hard to make it perfect, but we cannot guarantee it.
4.2. Limitation of Liability: Allwaysever is not responsible for any losses, damages, or consequences arising from the User's use of MirAI. You are fully responsible for what you do with MirAI. Remember: AI doesn't have a conscience, but you do (we hope so).
4.3. AI Output Is Not Advice: The output from MirAI is for informational and creative purposes only. The output is not a substitute for professional advice (such as legal, medical, or financial advice). You should always test and verify the information you get from MirAI before using it for important matters.
4.4. Works Are Yours: All Works you generate with MirAI are yours, provided you comply with this license. We do not claim ownership of your Works, but we might show them to our friends and say, "Hey, look what they made with our AI!" (with your permission, of course).

- If you use AI to create a scam, we'll know. And we might tell your mom.
- We know, these articles are boring. But trust us, they're much less boring than a lawsuit.
