# Troubleshooting

Experiencing issues? Try checking the solutions below before asking.

### Error: "Oops! It seems there's a problem..."
This message generally appears for one of two reasons:
1.  **Connection Problem:** Your internet might be unstable. Try reloading the page.
2.  **API Key Problem:** The default API Key might be reaching its usage limit. This can happen if many users are accessing MirAI at the same time.
    -   **Best Solution:** Use your own [Google API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey). Enter the key in the **Settings > API Key** menu.

### Application Stuck on the "You're Offline" Screen
The application checks your connection when it first loads. If it fails, a "Try Again" button will appear. Make sure your device is connected to the internet before pressing that button.

### My `/` command isn't working
Make sure your command format is correct. Each command has its own format.
-   **Incorrect Example:** `/translate to japanese i love coding`
-   **Correct Example:** `/translate i love coding to japanese`

Type `/` in the input box to see the correct format guide for each command.

### Why did my chat disappear after refreshing the page?
The chat history is **not currently saved** if you close or reload the page. This feature may be added in the future. To clear the chat manually, use the **trash can** button below the menu button.
